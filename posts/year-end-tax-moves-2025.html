                <p>As 2025 winds down, there's still time to reduce your tax bill - if you make a few smart moves before year-end. Many strategies take effect only if completed by December 31, so acting early gives more flexibility</p>

                <h2>1) Max Out Retirement Contributions</h2>
                <p>Contributing to a 401(k) or traditional IRA can lower your taxable income immediately.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>401(k) limit:</strong> $23,000 for 2025 (+$7,500 catch-up if 50+)</li>
                    <li><strong>IRA limit:</strong> $7,000 (+$1,000 catch-up if 50+)</li>
                </ul>
                <div classs="pro-tip"><strong>Example:</strong> In the 24% bracket, adding $5,000 to your 401(k) before Dec 31 reduces your federal tax by about <strong>$1,200</strong> ($5,000 x 24%).</div>
                
                <h2>2) Harvest Investment Losses</h2>
                <p>Sell investments that are down to offset gains (tax-loss harvesting). You can also use up to $3,000 of net capital losses to offset ordinary income each year. Avoid wash sales by waiting 31 days before buying back the same security.</p>
                
                <h2>3) Review Withholding & Estimated Taxes</h2>
                <p>If you had bonuses, freelance income, or big investment gains, check whether you've paid enough tax. Adjust your final 2025 estimated payment (due Jan 15, 2026) to avoid underpayment penalties</p>

                <h2>4) Consider Charitable Giving Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Donate appreciated stock to avoid capital gains and get a deduction if you itemize.</li>
                    <li>Use a donor-advised fund for larger gifts and timing flexibility</li>
                    <li>"Bunch" of multiple years of donations into 2025 if you're near the itemizing threshold.</li>
                </ul>
